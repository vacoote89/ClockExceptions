# Clock

Write a program that prompts the user to enter time in 12-hour notation. The program then outputs the time in 24-hour notation. Your program must contain three exception classes: InvalidHourException, InvalidMinuteException, and InvalidSecondException. If the user enters an invalid value for hours, then the program should throw and catch an InvalidHourException object. Follow similar conventions for the invalid values of minutes and seconds.

## Sample Outputs
```
1:23:04 PM is 13:24:04

12:01:14 AM is 00:01:14

3:12:19 AM is 03:12:19
```
